# Diabetes Prediction using KNN
## Overview
This repository contains the code for developing a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model for diabetes classification, which aims to identify individuals at risk of diabetes based on various health parameters. Diabetes is a growing health concern globally, and early detection plays a crucial role in effective management and treatment.

The study utilizes a dataset that includes factors such as blood pressure, BMI, age, and glucose levels to assess diabetes risk. The KNN model assists healthcare providers by offering insights into potential diabetes cases, allowing for proactive interventions to improve patient outcomes.

## The code in this repository handles:

Data preprocessing and cleaning to prepare the dataset for analysis.
Implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for diabetes classification.
Evaluation of model performance through metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Visualization of results to interpret model predictions and identify risk factors.
